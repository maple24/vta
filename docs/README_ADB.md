## ways to start an android application
```sh
adb shell am start -n <package_name>/<activity_name>
#  If you're unsure about the activity name, you can use the application package name alone, and Android will attempt to start the default/main activity of the application.
adb shell am start -n com.example.myapp/.MainActivity
```
### find package name
```sh
adb shell pm list packages
```
### find activity name
```sh
adb shell cmd package resolve-activity --brief <package_name>
```
